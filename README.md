How the program works:

    The user is asked to input two numbers (num1 and num2).
    The user is also prompted to choose a mathematical operation (+, -, *, /).
    The program checks the operation and performs the appropriate calculation.
    If the division operation is selected, the program checks for division by zero to avoid errors.
    The result is displayed in a clear format, showing both the operation and the result.
    If the user enters an invalid operation, the program prints an error message.

Example output:

Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5
Enter the operation (+, -, *, /): +
10.0 + 5.0 = 15.0
